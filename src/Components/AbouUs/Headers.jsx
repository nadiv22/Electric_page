        <p className="para-1">
          We’re Christopher and Shawn, the founders of DRIVER. What<br></br>
          makes us good friends and business partners is our passion for
          <br></br>
          people, creative solutions, sustainability, and electric vehicles.
          <br></br>
          One weekend, during a backpacking trip in the San Bernardino<br></br>
          National Forest, we discovered we could make a positive impact
          <br></br>
          on our planet even after we left the forest. Thus, DRIVER was<br></br>
          born. Through self-sustainable vehicles, we could prevent carbon
          <br></br>
          emissions from harming the environment. With one rental<br></br>
          company, our goal is to inspire the community and the world to
          <br></br>
          opt out of renting gas-powered vehicles and rent sustainable<br></br>
           all-electric cars instead.
